The base code is taken from the corresponding paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12595) "MultiDoc2Dial: Modeling Dialogues Grounded in Multiple Documents" (EMNLP 2021) by Song Feng *, Siva Sankalp Patel*, Wan Hui and Sachindra Joshi.


## Installation

Please refer to "conda_env.yml" for creating a virtual environment.

"conda env create -f conda_env.yml"

Our scripts require to set the following environment variables,
- `HF_HOME`- for caching downloads from Huggingface locally.
- `CHECKPOINTS` for saving the checkpoints. You can also manually change $CHECKPOINTS in the "sh" files below.

Alongside this, please also install the following libraries:
"pip3 install git+https://github.com/boudinfl/pke.git"
"pip3 install spacy==2.1.0"
"pip3 install numpy==1.23.5"
"python3 -m spacy download en_web_sm"
"pip3 install neuralcoref"

## Data

Please run the commands to download data. It will download the document and dialogue data into folder  `data/multidoc2dial`.

"cd scripts
./run_download.sh"

## Processing Data
To process data and create history modeled formats please run either: 
"./run_data_preprocessing.sh structure generation nohm" For no history Modeling (using full conversational context)
"./run_data_preprocessing.sh structure generation kp" For keyphrase extraction history Modeling
"./run_data_preprocessing.sh structure generation qs" For turn selector history Modeling
"./run_data_preprocessing.sh structure generation coref" For coreference resolution history Modeling



## Run Baselines
To recreate our baseline results (DPR + BART) please run:
"python3 run_dpr_baseline.py"
"python3 run_bart_baseline.py"

## Fine-tuning RAG model
please run:
"./run_converted_modelcard.sh all structure"

To create index please run:
"./run_kb_index.sh all structure"

To run training:
"./run finetune_rag_dialdoc.sh all structure original generation"


## Evaluations
To test different history models just rerun "./run_data_preprocessing.sh" with $hm parameters, no need to train the model again and again. Training should be done only with "nohm" (no hisotry model)

Please run:
"./run_eval_rag_re.sh all structure original generation test"
"./run_eval_rag_e2e.sh all structure original generation test"
